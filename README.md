CSC DevOps - Milestone 2
===================
MILESTONE : TEST + ANALYSIS
--------------------------
Milestone 2 is the testing and analysis section of the project, and comprises the components that ensure correctness of a commit.

Target Project
--------------
[Apache Commons CSV](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/)  
Source: [Apache Commons CSV](https://github.com/apache/commons-csv)

Team Members
------------
Shashanka Sharma (srsharma)  
Jitesh Mohan (jitesh)  
Sheenam Mittal (smittal3)  

###Tools Used
1. Jenkins
2. Eclipse
3. Git

###TEST SECTION
Tools Used:  
1. Cobertura (Jenkins Plugin)  
2. Randoop (Eclipse Plugin)  

###ANALYSIS SECTION
Tools Used:  
1. Findbugs (Jenkins Plugin)  

MILESTONE COMPONENTS
--------------------
1. Unit Tests and Coverage  
We used cobertura to report the coverage obtained on running the standard unit tests provided in the target project. The coverage results for thee unit test is:  

2. Advanced Testing Technique  
We extended the coverage using an external test case generation plugin, Randoop. Randoop is installed on Eclipse, and is used to create multiple random testcases.

3. Base Analysis
4. Extended Analysis
Implemented a new analysis from scratch which gives a detailed report on the ratio of the total number of code lines to the total comments for each file. It then compares this ratio against a threshold.The analysis is implemented via a script written in Python which reports the results to console as well as writes it to a file.

5. Testing Gate
The build fails if the coverage is less than a sepcified minimum, because for our project the coverage was very high we tried with 97% for conditions which was 92% coverage and the build failed.

6. Analysis Gate
For this part we have found the code to comment ratio and if the ratio is below a given thresh hold, 10% for us, the build will fail. We wrote a pre-push hook to reject the commit for this case.

7. Security Token Gate
If any of the files in project is has an extension .pem, .key  or if the files contains api keys or tokens the build fails. The check for these consitions is written using a python script and pre push hook.
