--------------------------
Milestone 2 is the testing and analysis section of the project, and comprises the components that ensure correctness of a commit.

Target Project
--------------
[Apache Commons CSV](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/)  
Source: [Apache Commons CSV](https://github.com/apache/commons-csv)

Team Members
------------
Shashanka Sharma (srsharma)  
Jitesh Mohan (jitesh)

###Tools Used
1. Jenkins
2. Eclipse
3. Git

###TEST SECTION
Tools Used:  
1. Cobertura (Jenkins Plugin)  
2. Randoop (Eclipse Plugin)  

###ANALYSIS SECTION
Tools Used:  
1. Findbugs (Jenkins Plugin)  

MILESTONE COMPONENTS
--------------------
1. Unit Tests and Coverage  
We used cobertura to report the coverage obtained on running the standard unit tests provided in the target project. The coverage results for thee unit test is:  

2. Advanced Testing Technique  
We extended the coverage using an external test case generation plugin, Randoop. Randoop is installed on Eclipse, and is used to create multiple random testcases.

3. Base Analysis
4. Extended Analysis
Implemented a new analysis from scratch which gives a detailed report on the ratio of the total number of code lines to the total comments for each file. It then compares this ratio against a threshold.The analysis is implemented via a script written in Python which reports the results to console as well as writes it to a file.

5. Testing Gate
We have implemented 2 testing gates. 
 1.  
 2. Once both checks of the previous step pass we initiate a build on Jenkins.
 3. 
6. Analysis Gate

7. Security Token Gate
